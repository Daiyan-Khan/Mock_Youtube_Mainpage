# Mock YouTube Main Page

This project is a mock YouTube main page created using HTML and CSS. It simulates the appearance and layout of the YouTube main page to provide a visual representation of the popular video-sharing platform.

## Project Overview

The mock YouTube main page consists of the following components:

- Header: The header section includes the YouTube logo, search bar, and navigation links.
- Video Thumbnails: A grid of video thumbnails is displayed, showcasing a selection of popular videos.
- Sidebar: The sidebar contains various sections, such as the subscription list, trending videos, and recommended channels.
- Footer: The footer includes links to additional information, such as terms of service, privacy policy, and contact details.

## Technologies Used

The project was built using the following technologies:

- HTML: Used for structuring the web page and defining the layout.
- CSS: Used for styling the elements, applying colors, fonts, and spacing.

## Usage

To view the mock YouTube main page, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The page will be rendered, and you can interact with it as you would with a real YouTube main page. You can click on video thumbnails, search for videos, and navigate through the sidebar sections.

## Customization

If you wish to customize the mock YouTube main page, you can modify the HTML and CSS files according to your preferences. You can change colors, fonts, layouts, and even add your own content to simulate a personalized YouTube experience.
